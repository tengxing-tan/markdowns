"I have **so much** things to do, and I only have a little time."
We feel overwhelm on that situation. 
It is normal, it is how our nervous system working.

To reduce the feeling of nervousness, we can do: 
- clarify the root cause, understand the question
- quantify tasks. Instead of "so much", find out the exact amount, i.e. "I have 3 tasks to settle"
- Deep breaths calm the mind. Box breathing or Physiological sigh 
- Name it to tame. Label your feeling. Say "I feel frustrated" instead of "I am frustrated" (). Because the emotion is temporary NOT your identity.
