While bookkeeping is capturing data, accounting compile into reports.

# Balance sheet
**Where** is the money for company to buy **assets**
- equities
	- accounts payable
	- retained earnings
	- stakeholders investment
- liability
	- debt
	- bank loan
Hence, accounting equation defined as ***assets = liability + equities***

What is **retained earnings**
- cost of sales
- head over expenses
- revenue/sales
- dividends (pay to stakeholder)

**Non-current asset**
- Equipment has max lifespan, i.e. 10 years
- Hence, non-current assets usually decreases in value every years
- The decrease amount called accumulated depreciation
	- depreciation, i.e. $1k per year
	- in 3 years, accumulated depreciation = $3k
- If a land increased value, it does not record in financial statement

**Lease contracts**
- The company has right to use the workplace, but it does not own it.
- After 2018, it must be reported in balance sheet

# Income statement
How much the company earn from consumer, i.e. you buy a phone $100
- Net sales
- Cost of sales / cost of goods sold
- Divide cost by sales, you know the costing & profit margin

**Warranty**
- i.e. a laptop with 2 years warranty
- selling price $1000, $100 for warranty
- the $100 will report after 2 years
- because revenue is not recognized until all customer value is received

**Earnings per share**
- Basic EPS = $net income/shares$
- Diluted EPS = $net income/shares + potentialShares$
	- potential shares includes options, warrants, so on.

# Cash flow

	- outflows: buy machines, land
- financing
